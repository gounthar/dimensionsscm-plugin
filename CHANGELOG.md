📅 released: 2021-04-06.
### 🐛 Bug fixes
* [JENKINS-65266](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-65266) -
  tables-to-div-regression in Jenkins v2.264+ (so Jenkins LTS v2.277+)

  forms if Jenkins Dimensions Plugin was installed. There remains a minor
  layout issue with the Changes page for a job
* Remove unneeded configuration in buildPlugin (#13) @timja
* Fix for mutual authentication auth (#12) @AnastasiaKozachuk
### 📦 Dependency updates

  Jenkins Dimensions Plugin yet anyway

## 0.8.18
📅 released: 2020-02-25.
### 🐛 Bug fixes

  @AnastasiaKozachuk

📅 released: 2018-11-19.
### 🐛 Bug fixes
* Baseline names generated using `[CURRENT_DATE]` were no longer legal in
  Dimensions CM 14.4, so changed colon separators to period characters. If you
  rely on the format of the baseline name including these (now invalid) colon
  characters you can revert to the old behavior by setting a system property
  (L3R08939)

## 0.8.15
📅 released: 2018-09-13.
### 🐛 Bug fixes
* [SECURITY-1065](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisories/) - Passwords
  were stored in configuration files with a straightforward reversible
  encoding - it is now encrypted with Jenkins' own encryption
* [SECURITY-1108](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisories/) - The
  validation on the configuration form was vulnerable to CSRF and didn't check
  Jenkins permissions appropriately
* *Important Security Note: Upgrading to this version of the plugin, in order
  to get both of these security fixes, is recommended for all users*

  infrastructure can be used (also plugin code is now licensed with simple
  standard MIT license)

  baseline operations should change the build state

📅 released: 2015-03-23.
### 🚀 New features and improvements
* The plugin now uses the Jenkins System log for debug-logging, and the
  logging and build output should include better detail about the reasons for
  any problem than in previous releases
### 🐛 Bug fixes
* Regular expression pattern-matching for upload of build artifacts was no
  longer using the full workspace-relative path, but just the filename
  component of the path; the full workspace-relative path is now used again

## 0.8.9
📅 released: 2014-12-10.
### 🚀 New features and improvements
* Can exclude file path patterns from being monitored for changes (for
  example, useful for built artifacts). Changes to excluded file patterns
  won't trigger a build, but will still be shown and updated when a build is
  eventually started by some subsequent change. The patterns to exclude are
  Ant-style patterns using `/` as a separator (even on Windows). For example,
  `**/target/**` would ignore changes in any `target` directory in the
  repository, and `**/*.class` would ignore changes to any `.class` files in
  the repository
* Exclusion filters added to exclude paths from monitoring when polling SC...

  as regular expressions
